### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kyle (he/him).

I'm currently a Staff Platform Engineer at [EraDB](https://eradb.com/). Previously I worked at [Thorn](https://www.thorn.org/) as a Staff Engineer and [Zapproved](https://zapproved.com/) as a Tech Lead. My passions and interest are generally focused around designing architectures and solutions to complex problems with a focus on solutions with a cloud first approach. I have published my own ebook + video course focused on [Learning AWS By Using It](https://kylegalbraith.com/learn-aws/).
