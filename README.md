### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kyle (he/him).

I'm the co-founder & CEO of [Depot](https://depot.dev) where we are working to eliminate wasted time waiting for slow builds. Previously I worked at Era Software as a Staff Platform Engineer, [Thorn](https://www.thorn.org/) as a Staff Engineer and [Zapproved](https://zapproved.com/) as a Tech Lead.

I've also written my own book and currently live in Montpellier, France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·

You can follow me on [X](https://twitter.com/kylegalbraith), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kylegalbraith459/), and [my personal blog](https://blog.kylegalbraith.com) where I share some of my expat journey and more non-founder thoughts.
